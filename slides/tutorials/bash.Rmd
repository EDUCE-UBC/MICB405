A bit about my background:

I grew up in Seattle, Washington, and went to school at UC Berkeley where I studied Neurobiology and French Literature.

I did my undergraduate research work on mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease at UCSF

I graduated from Cal in 2018 and worked for a year at a biotech company in Bothell, Washington.

I started my graduate studies at UBC last September. I’m currently working on a bioinformatics project at the Hirst Lab related to reference genome customization to improve the quality of epigenomic data.

I like to cycle and ski in my free time

This is my first experience TAing so any feedback would be welcome!
