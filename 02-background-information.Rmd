# Background information

## Project information

Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) are widespread areas of low dissolved oxygen (DO) in subsurface waters. Climate change resulting in increased stratification and reduced oxygen solubility in warming waters leads to an expansion of OMZ. Consequently as oxygen levels decline, the microbial communities inhabiting OMZ waters shift their metabolisms to utilize alternative terminal electron acceptors. This results in the production of climate active trace gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). OMZs provide useful environmental contexts in which to study coupled biogeochemical cycling through microbial metabolic networks. By combining 'omics data with biogeochemical data from OMZs it becomes possible to evaluate regulatory and response dynamics of microbial communities to changing DO levels. In this study, Saanich inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia, was used as a model ecosystem to study microbial community responses to changing DO levels.

## Data collection

Multi-omic sequence information (DNA, RNA and proteins) from Saanich Inlet along with geochemical parameter information was collected over many years prodicing a time series record of recurring water column stratificaiton and deep water renewal. For this tutorial, 90 metagenomes spanning water colum redix gradients in space and time, totalling 4.1 TB of cleaned reads or 16.2 GB of assembled data, were prepared. [(a) Oxygen concentration contour for CTD data (February 2008 onward)35 indicating 16 sampling depths for water column geochemistry and high-resolution (HR) DNA samples for SSU libraries (small black dots) and six major depths for large volume (LV) samples for meta-genomics, -transcriptomics, -proteomics and LV SSU libraries (large black dots). (b) Sample inventory from February 2006 to October 2014 indicating multi-omic datasets included in this manuscript (solid black), in previous publications (gray) and accompanying datasets currently undergoing processing and analysis (open gray).](data_multi-omic_samples.png)
