# Background information

## Project information
Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) are widespread areas of low dissolved oxygen (DO) in subsurface waters. Climate change resulting in increased stratification and reduced oxygen solubility in warming waters leads to an expansion of OMZ. Consequently, the microbial communities shift their metabolism to utilize alternative terminal electron acceptors to adapt to limiting DO conditions. This results in the release of climate active trace gases such as N2O and CH4.
OMZs  provide useful environmental contexts in which to study coupled biogeochemical cycling through microbial metabolic networks. Coupling 'omics data with biogeochemical data from the OMZs, the regulatory and response dynamics of microbial communities in the OMZs to changing DO levels can be studied. 
In this study, Saanich inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord in British Columbia, was used as a model to study microbial community responses to changing DO levels.

## Data collection
Multi-omic sequence information from the Saanich Inlet along with geochemical data was collected over six years from the Saanich Inlet. For the context of this tutorial, 90 metagenomes, totalling 4.1 TB of cleaned reads or 16.2 GB of assembled data, were obtained.
