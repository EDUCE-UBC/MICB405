## Information for Developers

A push to the `main` branch triggers a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) [workflow](.github/workflows/deploy_bookdown.yml) using GitHub Actions and publishes the new version of the website on the branch `gh-pages`. You can build the website in a local repo using the "Build Book" button in RStudio and its output will be saved in the `_book` directory but it won't be tracked by Git.
