# Windows 10 {-}

## Updating the operating system {-}

```{r child = here("Rmds", "child_Rmds", "os_warning.Rmd")}
```

Please update to the latest version of Windows 10: version `r params$windows_version`.
(Major Windows versions indicate in which half of the year they were released, i.e. the latest version `r params$windows_version` in `r params$windows_version_release_date`.)

- Check your current Windows version ![](`r here("images", "one.png")`){width=3%}: Select the Windows Start button > Settings > System > About > scroll to bottom of page

  ![](`r here("images", "windows_version.png")`){width=75%}

- If you do not have the latest version installed: Select the Windows Start button > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update

  ![](`r here("images", "windows_update.png")`){width=75%}

- If Windows Update does not offer the latest version, then manually update by going to [Windows 10 Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) and choosing the latest version.

## Working on a server with OpenSSH {-}

These instructions will ensure that your local computer can connect to a Linux server and copy files between them using a suite of software tools called OpenSSH and the Windows Terminal app.

-   OpenSSH comes pre-installed if you have Windows 10 version 1803 or newer. If you updated to the latest Windows 10 version, you should already have OpenSSH available to you. If your Windows 10 version is older because you cannot update, follow the [official Microsoft documentation on installing OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).

-   Go to [Microsoft Store Windows Terminal website](https://aka.ms/terminal) > click the "Get" button to install the app.
