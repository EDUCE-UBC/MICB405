In text-paragraphs, code is always formatted with a monospace font and surrounded by a box, like `this`. Longer examples of code will be in their own separate box.

    First line of code
    Second line of code
    ...

In many cases the output for code in these boxes will be below them.

Replace any placeholder indicated by angular brackets `<placeholder>` with your own code.

Pressing a <kbd>Key</kbd> on the keyboard is formatted like that.
