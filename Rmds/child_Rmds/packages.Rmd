### R packages

R packages are units of shareable code, containing functions that facilitate and enhance analyses. In simpler terms, think of R packages as iPhone Applications. Each App has specific capabilities that can be accessed when we install and then open the application. The same holds true for R packages. To use the functions contained in a specific R package, we first need to install the package, then each time we want to use the package we need to "open" the package by loading it.

While installing packages you might be prompted:

```
  There is a binary version available but the source version is later:

<table of package names>

Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

Always enter `no` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>.
