# R and RStudio {-}

To complete the installs of R and RStudio, you must have administrator privileges on your machine. Choose the version appropriate for your operating system. You can also watch a video for a [Mac](https://youtu.be/Oy9BPxt8gQ0?t=270) or a [Windows](https://youtu.be/7f9ADV2v7CI?t=336) install (you only need to install R and RStudio, and none of the other programs mentioned in the videos). Please also note that the versions of R and RStudio in the video are older. Instead, install or update to the latest version supported by your operating system.

1. R https://cran.r-project.org/
    - version `r getRversion()` (only for macOS Yosemite or older: legacy version `r params$r_legacy_version`)
    - Choose among "Download and Install R" section (**not** "Source Code for all Platforms").
    
        **Note for Mac users:** If you have an M1 (and higher) Mac, you **must** install the Intel version of R (Bioconductor packages installed below are not yet compatible with the arm64 version).
        
    - You **must** have R installed before proceeding to step 2.
1. RStudio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
    - Version `r params$rstudio_version` (only for macOS El Capitan and older: legacy version `r params$rstudio_legacy_version`)
    - Select FREE Desktop version.
    - Choose among "Installers for Supported Platforms" section (**not** "Zip/Tarballs") or follow the link to older versions of RStudio if you need a legacy version.
1. In RStudio:
    - Select the "Console" tab of the left panel ![](`r here("images", "one.png")`){width=3%}.
    - Copy the following code after the prompt `>` ![](`r here("images", "two.png")`){width=3%} to install all necessary packages:
 
        ```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
        if (!require(tidyverse))    install.packages("tidyverse")
        if (!require(pheatmap))     install.packages("pheatmap")
        if (!require(RColorBrewer)) install.packages("RColorBrewer")
        if (!require(BiocManager))  install.packages("BiocManager")
        if (!require(DESeq2))       BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
        ```

        While installing (or updating, see below) packages, you might be prompted:

        ```
          There is a binary version available, but the source version is later:
        
        <table of package names>
        
        Do you want to install from sources the package which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
        ```

        Always enter `no` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>.

    - Update packages by selecting the "Packages" tab of the bottom right panel ![](`r here("images", "three.png")`){width=3%} and then click on "Update" ![](`r here("images", "four.png")`){width=3%}.
    
        ![](`r here("images", "update_packages.png")`){width=100%}

    - If any packages are listed, first click on "Select All" ![](`r here("images", "one.png")`){width=3%} and then "Install Updates" ![](`r here("images", "two.png")`){width=3%}.
    
        ![](`r here("images", "update_packages_window.png")`){width=100%}

## Check that it worked {-}

After you open RStudio, it should look like the screenshot below with the left panel (the "console") listing the most current R version for your operating system ![](`r here("images", "one.png")`){width=3%}.

![](`r here("images", "version.png")`){width=100%}

## Troubleshooting {-}

### RStudio looks incorrect {-}

If you only see a single panel instead of 3 like in the example image, you likely opened base R instead of RStudio. Look for the RStudio logo ![](`r here("images", "rstudio_logo.png")`){width=2%} to open the correct program.

If you confirmed RStudio is open but don't see the same panels as depicted above, then in the RStudio menu bar, select View > Panes > Show all panes.

### My computer won't let me open the downloaded files to install them {-}

**Mac**: right-click and choose "Open With" > "Installer.app (default)" and select "Open" when prompted if you are sure you want to open the file

**Windows**: right-click and choose "Run as administrator"

### Still doesn't work {-}

Please come to one of the office hours to get help.
