# Introduction & Linux Server Accounts

Welcome to the first MICB 405 lab! Today, we're going to get started with the essential skills and tools you'll be using for the rest of the course.

## Slides

```{r embed-xaringan, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "slides/tutorials/bash.html",
                              ratio = "4:3")
```

You can download the slides for this tutorial below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
downloadthis::download_file(
  path         = here("slides", "tutorials", "bash.pdf"),
  output_name  = "introduction_and_linux_server_accounts",
  button_label = "Download slides"
)
```

## Logging in

Once you have followed the setup steps and have opened Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS, Linux), you should be ready to log in!

Use the following command, replacing `<username>` with your actual username:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
ssh <username>@orca1.bcgsc.ca
```

Enter your password when prompted. Don't worry when characters don't appear - this is an intentional security feature.

You may have to respond to additonal prompts by typing in an answer (such as `yes`) and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Let’s break this command down: `ssh` is the command and stands for "secure shell". It allows users to log on to remote (opposite of "local", which is your computer in this instance) servers. All following text is the argument. There may be many arguments and each of these would be separated by spaces. `<username>` is mostly obvious, but crucially this positions your shell in the `home` directory of username on the server’s system with the correct permissions. If everyone were to log on as `root` ("Administrator" in Windows-speak) this would be bad. `orca1.bcgsc.ca` (everything after the `@`) is known as the hostname or domain name and is the name of the device on the network it is connected to. Super-nerds sometimes replace this with the IP address.

## Bonus work

Review the manual pages for `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` by typing `man` followed by the command. Can you use them to move through your local machine's folder system and find out where you are? How about the Orca server?

To exit the `man` page, press <kbd>q</kbd>.

### Delve into man pages and help

1.	What is the difference between the `man` page, and `--help` or `-h` argument added to a command? When would you use either option? (try it on some commands, or look through StackExchange if you're confused)

1.	Here is a list of Bash commands often used in bioinformatics. Look up the `man` page for at least one of them. What do you think they do? Hypothetically, in what way do you think they could be used in a bioinformatics context? Which arguments would be the most handy? Discuss within your group!
    1. `grep`
    1. `tr`
    1. `awk`


### Terminal keyboard shortcuts

#### Basics

-   Autocomplete command:

    <kbd>TAB</kbd>
    
-   Navigate command history:

    <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd>
    
-   Kill process:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
    
-   End terminal or ssh session:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>
    
-   Search command history:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>

#### Navigating Text

-   Move to beginning of line:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>
    
-   Move to end of line:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>
    
-   Move back one word:

    <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>
    
-   Move forward one word:

    <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>

#### Advanced

-   Terminal Cut (Kill) text before cursor:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>
    
-   Terminal Cut (Kill) text after cursor:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>
    
-   Terminal Paste (Yank):

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd>
    
-   Undo in-line action:

    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>_</kbd>

Create a new file by running `nano testfile.txt` in your home directory or on your local machine (Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> to save and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit `nano`).

After typing some text, can you navigate, copy, and paste text without using the mouse? With some practice this will be a lot faster.
